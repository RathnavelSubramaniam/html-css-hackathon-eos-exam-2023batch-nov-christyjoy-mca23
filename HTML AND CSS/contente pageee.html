        </h3>
        <P> Starbucks sales account for about 33% of all coffee sales in the U.S (Pride & Ferrell, 2013). 
            Such immense success is to a large extent caused by the efficiency of Starbucks’s marketing strategy. 
            Starbucks’s target customers are people aged between 25 and 40 years old which bring almost half of revenue
             to the company (Pride & Ferrell, 2013).   

            In addition, Starbucks targets two more customer groups: young adults group and group including kids and teens. The former group accounts for about 40% of total revenue of Starbucks, and the latter group accounts for only 2% of sales (Pride & Ferrell, 2013). However, it is important to note that the majority of items for the latter group are purchased by their parents
             and therefore high sales of the primary customer group reflect a combined demand of adults and “kids and teens” group.</P>
