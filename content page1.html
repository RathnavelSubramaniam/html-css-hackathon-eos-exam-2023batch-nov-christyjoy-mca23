                    <p> The concept of the world being flat has extended beyond geographical boundaries to the rapid blurring 
                        and demolition of economic ones. Globalisation is not an expansionary mindset anymore and in many cases,
                         a strategic imperative to identify growth opportunities. Organisations are increasingly looking beyond their
                          national markets. E-commerce and the emergence of digital and social marketing practices have led to a level 
                          playing field for organisations and customers and have redefined competition. Price wars have become increasingly
                           common. Established brands are increasingly under threat from emerging private label brands.

                        Given the massive interconnectedness of the business world and emerging models of competition and growth,
                         how can organisations maintain their core underlying brand identity? In addition to competitive market factors,
                         
                         worldwide external shocks like the global recession have also severely impacted businesses at both local and global level. 
                         The key question that emerges is that whether there is now a continual need for brands to adapt or face the threat of extinction 
                         if they practice consistency.

                         To find answers to some of these questions, let us look at one of the world’s most iconic brands – Starbucks.
                          Founded in 1971 in the city of Seattle, USA, the brand has changed the way the world drinks coffee outside
                           home and work. Starbucks has been responsible for creating the concept of a third place between home and
                            work where people can relax, enjoy a cup of coffee and experience the inviting ambience. It is often said
                             that Starbucks taught America how to drink coffee and is now continuously teaching the world.
